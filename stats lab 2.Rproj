## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

question 1) 

scores <- c(46,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10)

sum(scores)/length(scores)

mean(scores)

min(scores)

max(scores)

numbers_to_test <- min(scores):max(scores)

sum_deviations <-c() 
for(i in numbers_to_test) {
  sum_deviations[i] <- sum(scores-i)
}

plot (sum_deviations)
